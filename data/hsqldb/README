This directory contains the initial data of Sun's "Duke's Bank" J2EE sample application.

The file "db1-00000000.0.zip" contains a Hypersonic SQL database "script" file comprising the DDL and insert statements necessary to initialise the Duke's Bank schema:

   $ unzip -l db1-00000000.0.zip 
   Archive:  db1-00000000.0.zip
     Length     Date   Time    Name
    --------    ----   ----    ----
           0  03-15-08 22:28   db1/
        9140  03-14-08 16:02   db1/db1.script
    --------                   -------
        9140                   2 files

The database was created by executing the following targets from the "jboss-build.xml" file in "src/j2eetutorial14/examples/bank" (assuming you have Ant and Java in your PATH):

   $ ant -Djboss.home=/home/anthony/dukesbank/jboss-4.0.3SP1 -buildfile jboss-build.xml db-create-table
   Buildfile: jboss-build.xml
   
   db-create-table:
        [java] update count 0
   
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 0 seconds
   
   $ ant -Djboss.home=/home/anthony/dukesbank/jboss-4.0.3SP1 -buildfile jboss-build.xml db-insert
   Buildfile: jboss-build.xml
   
   db-insert:
        [java] update count 1
   
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 0 seconds

... and creating a Zip archive of the resulting database file.
